# CRM Sales Opportunities Project

## 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes a B2B sales‑pipeline dataset from Maven Analytics.  
The dataset simulates CRM (Customer Relationship Management) records for a fictitious company selling computer hardware. It includes data about sales opportunities, accounts, sales agents/teams, and products — allowing analysis of pipeline performance, sales conversion, and sales team effectiveness. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## 2. Objectives
1. Understand the distribution of sales opportunities by status, stage, account, product, and sales agent.  
2. Analyze revenue potential and success (won vs lost deals) over time.  
3. Identify top‑performing sales agents, accounts or products.  
4. Track pipeline trends by quarter/ month / sales rep / region (if available).  
5. Practice SQL skills: joins across multiple tables, filters, aggregates (SUM, COUNT), date manipulations, grouping, and ranking.  

## 3. Tools & Environment
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server (or any SQL‑capable RDBMS)  
- **IDE / Client:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), or any SQL client of choice  
- **Data Source:** CSVs from Maven Analytics — import into database tables, define relationships (primary key / foreign key) between tables.
