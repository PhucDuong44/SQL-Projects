# Restaurant Orders Analysis

## 1. Project Overview
This project analyzes a restaurant order dataset from Alice Zhao. The dataset contains detailed information about customer orders, including items ordered, quantities, prices, and order dates.

## 2. Objectives
1. Explore the dataset and understand ordering patterns.  
2. Identify the most popular dishes and categories.  
3. Analyze revenue trends over time.  
4. Examine customer behavior and frequency of orders.  
5. Detect potential patterns in peak hours, busy days, or seasonal trends.  

## 3. Dataset
- Source: Alice Zhao – Restaurant Orders Dataset  
- Key columns:  
  - `Order ID` – unique identifier for each order  
  - `Item Name` – name of the menu item  
  - `Quantity` – number of items ordered  
  - `Item Price` – price per item  
  - `Order Date` – date and time of the order  
- Notes: Some orders may have missing or inconsistent data; cleaning and normalization may be necessary before analysis.

## 4. Tools & Environment
- **Database:** Microsoft SQL Server  
- **IDE:** SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  
- **Data Source:** Restaurant Orders dataset from Alice Zhao  

## 5. Key Learnings
- Top-selling dishes and their contribution to total revenue.  
- Peak ordering times during the day and week.  
- Insights into order quantities, average bill per customer, and popular item combinations.  
- Trends in revenue growth over time and seasonal patterns.  

## 6. Next Steps
- Clean and normalize the dataset for consistent analysis.  
- Aggregate data by category, day, or hour for deeper insights.  
- Use SQL queries to calculate revenue, popular items, and peak hours.  
- Integrate with visualization tools (Power BI, Tableau) for dashboards.  
- Explore predictive modeling for demand forecasting or menu optimization.
